**College Management System**

We have developed a college management system using React JS. It has the following functionalities:
1. Login and sign up with dummy authentication
2. CRUD Operations
3. Search and Filter
4. Uploading documents
5. Notifications using Toastify

There are still some functionalities missing in this project. Some pages in the project are responsive. For responsiveness, we have made use of Material UI and React Bootstrap. 

The future scope of our project is to integrate the backend into it and enable role-based access. 

Any suggestions to improve the project are appreciated.
